Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked:
- Reading through the OneCard example
- Looking at YouTube tutorials on O.O.P. to re-grasp the concept from class (I looked at this one doing this assignment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeznW_7DlB0&t=1970s)
- Planning my approach to the assignment on paper. First I read README.md and then I brainstormed on paper.
- Searching up what certain errors like AttributeError means

What didn't:
- Sitting there staring at the screen for more than 15 minutes
- Modifying bits of code (I find just rewriting code to be more helpful)

Advice to someone taking this course in the future:
- Actively try to solve your problems (write them out, dissect them, ask your professor about them)
- Look closely at the README.md and rubric to clearly understand assignments
- Code along with the professors in class
- More practice = better!

! Note:
- I was seriously *so confused* about how to test my code. I assumed it might be on main.py but it was built based on procedural_resale_shop.py so I became even more confused.
- Eventually, I concluded that I needed to make my own test to be able to test my program, which I did and rewrote main.py. 
- If I could give some feedback to the writers of this assignment, I would be interested in knowing what I was supposed to do to *test my code* and the potential link of that to the main.py. Maybe some specifications on the use of certain files would be great guidance.
